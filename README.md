# Distributed-Ray-Tracer
Base source files were written by Steven Parker at the University of Utah. My additions include implementing the recursive ray tracing algorithm and producing distributed ray tracing effects, namely anti-aliasing, depth of field, and motion blur. The core files for these effects can be found in Scene.cc, LambertianMaterial.cc, and ThinLensCamera.cc.  

The base image shows the final ray traced product of Program 1 without the effects of anti-aliasing, depth of field and motion blur. The maximum ray depth is 4.
